* Implement methods of RShape and RGroup

** insertSplit* methods: should modify in-place
*** insertSplit()
*** insertSplits()
*** insertSplitsAll()

** segment* methods: should return a segmentated result
*** segment()
*** segmentMode()
**** must determine how the segmentator sould split the commands (force the splitted commands to LINETO s)

** adapt*: should return an adapted result

** split*: should return the two resulting sides fo the split


* Implementation

** Object hierarchy revision
*** RCommand -> RCubicBezier, RQuadBezier, RLine, RArc should all inherit from RCommand
*** RGeomElem -> RGroup, RShape, RSubShape, RCommand should all inherit from RGeomElem

** Cache of polygons, meshes, etc 


* API

** Rename createCircle -> createEllipse
** Rename setSegmentator -> segmentMode
** Rename setAdaptor -> adaptMode
** Move createEllipse, createStar, createRectangle... into RGeomerative.*
** Move segmentMode, adaptMode... into RGeomerative.*


* Documentation

** Everything!!
